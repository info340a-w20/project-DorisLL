        <h2>Topic Description</h2>
        <img src="imgs/CoursePlan.jpg" alt="Cartoon of Course Planning">
        <p>
            We, as college students, both have a feeling that choosing courses each quarter is important but difficult and tricky. 
            A good selection of courses leads to better GPA gained, more knowledge learnt, and more smoothly communication between 
            professors. As a result, college students spend a lot of time trying to find fellow students who have taken certain 
            courses and asked how the course is and what it is about. In addition, students are also interested in whether a 
            certain professor is good or what is the teaching style or method of a specific professor. In addition, a 
            plan for course is also time-consuming because certain courses are not provided each quarter and the requirements 
            for graduation is complex. 
        </p>
        <p>
            There are some resources online that provide some information for students to refer to while choosing class, like the 
            UW course evaluation and Rate My Professor. But there are still problems that have not been addressed. 
        </p>
        <p>
            UW course evaluation is comprehensive with evaluation for every faculty for each course but it is a rough evaluation 
            with only a score for each category. It is a little bit vague for students want to learn more about a class. On the 
            other hand, outer websites, like Rate My Professor enables users to leave comments and descriptions besides a rate 
            for a course and a professor. However, the comments online are less organized. 
        </p>
        <p>
            We would like to develop an application that may help students to better arrange their courses in a most efficient way. 
        </p>

                        Users can view comments and rates for each professor and for each course. They are able to filter schools and 
                        filter comments from different departments and academic background which make the information they get more 
                        accurate and precise to themselves.

                        The website is like a calendar that generate course plan for students automatically throughout years

                        The graduation requirements for each major should be saved in the system and being updated gradually when

                        Instead, they can use the course-plan generator to plan their courses. By providing extra information, 
                        like the number of credits they want to take each quarter or the earliest class they want to have each quarter, 
                        they are able to generate more accurate course plan that is more satisfying for themselves.

                        This web application will aim to provide students with suitable alternatives for classes which they are interested in.
                        Many students struggle with obtaining a spot in classes during enrollment, or not be able to complete sufficient pre 
                        requisites. This will be a solution a very common problem faced during registration.

                        University of Washington courses and their pre requisites should be saved in the system, in order to retrieve classes
                        with the same, or less pre recs than the current class being considered. The system will also store information from students
                        who have taken classes which can be reccomended. For example, a suitable alternative for CSE 154 may be INFO 340, and this information
                        would be presented by the application.
