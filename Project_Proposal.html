            <img src="imgs/CoursePlan.jpg" alt="Cartoon of Course Planning">
            <p>
                Considering current registration resources, students run into a range of problems when finding an ideal course schedule each quarter.
                An overarching issue is that students often have to consider a wide range of classes each quarter, in the case that they do not get
                their first options. The process of gaining knowledge about the structure and rigor of courses, in combination with building a schedule
                with all scheduling factors remains insufficient for a range of reasons.
            </p>
            <ul>
                <li><em>It is difficult to tell how cirriculums differ across similar classes:</em> There are many courses at UW which teach similar content,
                but with slight variation. Many courses may provide as substitutes to one another due to their similarities in topic, but with differences
                in pre requisite knowledge and class rigor. The description of classes in the course catalog is hardly sufficient in being able to select one 
                class over another, or finding a suitable alternative to a class which may have filled up. For example, a student may be looking to choose
                between INFO 340 and CSE 154, two web development classes. Current online resources do not provide sufficient descriptions of how these courses vary,
                in order for a student to make an informed decision on which one to take based on their academic needs. </li>
                <li><em>It is difficult to determine the reliability of current course / professor reviews:</em> The closest resource available to view individual
                feedback about a course would be Rate My Professor. However, the feedback given may not always be useful to students across the board. Students reviewing
                courses come from a variety of backgrounds, so one review may not be useful to every student. For example, a computer science major may give poor reviews to 
                a creative writing course. However, the quality of the review may just be due to the suitability of the student's skill set to the demand of the course.
                Upon searching for reviews on the course, a creative writing major will view this, with no indicator of the reviewers basis of knowledge. These reviews
                are presented in a 'one size fits all' fashion, despite the fact that certain classes may be a better fit for certain students.</li>
                <li><em>It can be very difficult to map out an ideal schedule, all factors considered: </em>Many students have a difficult time building a schedule for the 
                quarter, when it comes to taking the desired classes, without overlap, with the right professors. There are many moving parts of building a schedule, which
                makes it very difficult to keep track of all factors. Currently, there are systems in place where students may do their own course search, and select their
                own classes, and will only be informed if the schedule is not possible for the given sections, teachers, and courses (due to course capacity or time overlaps).
                MyPlan is a useful tool, but provides essentially no guidance in terms of different scheduling options, given a range of selected courses. </li>
            </ul>

            <p>
                We would like to develop an application that may help students to better arrange their courses in a most efficient way.

                            The web application is to help students access reviews for specific classes that are helpful to their academic background.

                        <li class="tasks">
                            In this application, a user will be able to search for a course, professor, and input their major as well as if they have taken
                            the course. If they have taken the course, they will be prompted to leave a review, consisting of a score out of five to determine
                            how helpful the course was to them, given their academic goals and their field of study. They may also select tags and leave a comment.
                            If they have not taken the class, they will be directed to the page with the reviews. The information that is shown will be unique to
                            the search criteria, as they will only view information which is relevant to that course and professor, with reviews from others in 
                            their specified major. They will be given summarizing information, most importantly a score out of 5 which represents how relevant this course
                            is to their academic pathway. This score will be generated as an average of two numbers. One, being an average score of all of the reviews
                            left by verified students. The other number which will contribute will be a more objective measure, based on the number of graduation 
                            requirements in that major which require you to take that class. For example, if 80% of the courses in a given major require you to take a 
                            specific class, this would make the objective portion of the overall score a 4/5. If, on average, students of a given major scored this class
                            a 5/5, the overall score that would be shown would be 4.5/5 (an average of both scores).

                            for a given class to either leave a suggestion for course alternatives to that class, or they will be able to simply view
                            the reviews which have already been left by different students. For example, if a user searches STAT 220, an alternative suggestion
                            would likely be STAT 311. They will be able to view what students say about their experience in one course or another. It could become
                            clear that although these classes often fill the same requirements, one would require a larger base of previous knowledge.
